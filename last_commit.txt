## 🔁 Filesystem Reorganization & New Modules
Today the `px4_ros_com` package source tree was reorganized and new module directories were added under `src/` to better separate concerns and host upcoming features.

### ✅ Changes
- Added directories under `src/px4_ros_com/src/`:
	- `controller/`         — core controllers and UAV entry point (e.g., `uav_controller.cpp`)
	- `formulations/`       — math/algorithm helper headers (e.g., `CalculateCentralPoint.hpp`)
	- `lib/`                — shared libraries (e.g., `frame_transforms`)
	- `object_detection/`   — vision & detection modules/scripts
	- `path_planner/`       — path planning algorithms and planners

- Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to build `main_class` from `src/controller/uav_controller.cpp` and to expose the new library targets.
- Added an initial formulation header `CalculateCentralPoint.hpp` (uses Eigen).

### ⚙️ Impact / Notes
- README (`/src/README.md`) updated to reflect new structure and to point to the actual build target location.
- `path_plan_controller.hpp` remains the next major development target (moved into controller/path_planner area depending on design).

### Next steps
1. Implement path planning logic in `path_planner/` and wire into the controller.
2. Add unit tests for `formulations/` (geometry/math correctness).
3. Clean up any outdated launch/config references and ensure CI uses the updated build layout.
