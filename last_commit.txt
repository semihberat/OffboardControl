ðŸ“… Last Development Session - December 2024

ðŸ”§ SWARM COMMUNICATION INTERFACE IMPLEMENTATION

âœ… Completed Features:
- Custom ROS2 interface package (custom_interfaces) for swarm coordination
- NeighborsInfo.msg definition with neighbor IDs and GPS data arrays
- Integrated neighbor GPS sharing into main_class.cpp offboard controller
- Added neighbor publisher to OffboardController base class
- GPS data distribution system for real-time swarm coordination

ðŸš€ Technical Implementation:
- custom_interfaces/msg/NeighborsInfo.msg:
  * uint8[] neighbors_ids: Array of neighbor drone system IDs
  * px4_msgs/SensorGps[] neighbors_gps: GPS position data from each neighbor
- Publisher: /neighbors_gps topic for GPS sharing across swarm
- Integration: Added to main_class.cpp with publish_gps_to_neighbors() method
- Dependencies: custom_interfaces package integrated into workspace build

ðŸ“‹ Workspace Updates:
- Updated README.md with neighbor communication features
- Added custom interface build instructions
- Enhanced API documentation with swarm communication methods
- Added troubleshooting section for neighbor interface debugging

ðŸŽ¯ Current System Capabilities:
- Multi-vehicle offboard control with PX4 autopilot
- ArUco world integration for computer vision applications
- Dual camera bridges (image + camera_info streams)
- Real-time GPS sharing between swarm members
- Custom message interfaces for advanced coordination
- Complete ROS2 Humble + Gazebo Harmonic integration

ðŸ”œ Next Development Areas:
- Neighbor position-based formation control algorithms
- Enhanced swarm coordination using shared GPS data
- Advanced collision avoidance with neighbor awareness
- Formation flight patterns utilizing neighbor information
